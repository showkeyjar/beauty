[general]
## Activate this to make rendered images suitable for ResNet-101
## for Face Recognition available here www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/augmented_faces/
## Note: This will automatically disable some of the other options specified here
## Moreover, you may have to code yourself in-plane alignment which is not provided here
resnetON = no

## Activate plotting
plotON = no

## Resize image to be fed into the CNN
resizeCNN = yes

## ConvNet imag size (used with resizeCNN)
cnnSize = 160

## Activate saving of rendered images
saveON = yes

## Number of total subjects for the 3D models 
nTotSub = 10

[renderer]
## Activate rendering of the background
background = yes 

## Activate soft-symmetry
symmetry = yes

## Parameters to get a bit far from the face when sampling the background
scaleFaceX = 0.25

## Activate Near View Rendering
nearView = yes

## If we want to use the new Rendered Views with the head better visible and more poses
newRenderedViews = yes

## (used if symmetry is applied)
[symmetry]

## If we want to flip the background in symmetry or no
flipBackground = no
